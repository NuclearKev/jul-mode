# jul-mode

jul-mode is a package for Emacs that allows you to easily manipulate
packages found in the user repositories for Dragora. It also lets you
easily install, upgrade, and remove packages.

## jul-mode.el

This is the main source file. All the code is based on code from the
`list-packages.el' file.

## notes.org

Very messy notes for figuring out how `list-packages' works.

## Goals

The main goal of the mode is to bring an easy-to-use package manager
for the user repos. However, I wish for it to be a tool that you can
use to do all package management on your Dragora system.
