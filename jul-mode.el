;;; Changelog:

;; 23 May 2016 - Wrote the installation and removal functions. They work!
;; 20 May 2016 - Started adding keys for doing tasks. Got installed stuff
;;               working.
;; 19 May 2016 - Got pulling of all repos and listing them on screen working.
;; 17 May 2016 - Got commication with server.
;; 16 May 2016 - Created package. On this day, I got something working.

;;; Commentary:

;; The idea behind jul-mode is to bring jul, the "package manager" for the
;; Dragora user repo, to Emacs.  This will hopefully make jul and the repos
;; easier to use and more powerful.  That being said, you will (hopefully) be
;; able to do most of your package management in jul-mode as well.

;; It's important to note that all of the code is based on (or from) the source
;; for the built-in Emacs package `package.el'.  Without that source, it would
;; have taken ages to write this.

;;; Todo:

;; * Test installation and removal of packages.
;; * Get updating working

;;; Code:
